# Spaceship Titanic-Dataset-Analysis
This repository contains an analysis of the Titanic dataset available on Kaggle. 

Dataset Overview
-
The Titanic dataset consists of various features for each passenger, such as age, sex, cabin class, fare, and survival status. The dataset is divided into two sets: training set (with survival information) and test set (without survival information). The main objective is to build a predictive model to determine the survival probability for passengers in the test set based on the patterns and relationships observed in the training set.


Analysis Overview
-
The analysis includes the following steps:

Data preprocessing: The training and test datasets are loaded and preprocessed to handle missing values, feature engineering, and data transformation as necessary.
Exploratory data analysis: Statistical summaries, visualizations, and data exploration techniques are applied to gain insights into the relationships between various features and the survival outcome.
Feature selection: Relevant features are selected based on their impact on the target variable and their usefulness in building a predictive model.
Model development: Different machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests) are trained using the training set and evaluated using cross-validation techniques.
Model evaluation: The models' performance is assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Predictions: The best-performing model is used to make predictions on the test set, generating survival probability predictions for each passenger.
Conclusion: The analysis concludes with a summary of the findings and potential insights gained from the Titanic dataset.
